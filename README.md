Usage: python LJSDF.py <training/testing file>

I.e.:  python LJSDF.py AND.txt

Note: 
To "training" the algorithm with a logic-gate, use as argument one of the text files provided (AND.txt, NAND.txt OR.txt, NOR.txt XOR.txt, and XNOR.txt)

To "testing" a logic-gate, copy the 3 weights files (weights.r, weights.rv, and weights.ra) from the logic-gate directory you want to test, into the same position where you're launching the python script. Use as argument one of the text files into the LOGIC_PATTERNS directories.
